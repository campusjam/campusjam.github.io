# Development History

The development process for Campus Jam conformed to [Issue Driven Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f16/modules/project-management/) practices. In a nutshell, development consists of a sequence of Milestones. Milestones consist of issues corresponding to 2-3 day tasks. GitHub projects are used to manage the processing of tasks during a milestone.  

The following sections document the development history of Campus Jam.

## Milestone 1: Mockup development

This milestone started on March 29, 2016 and ended on April 13, 2017.

The goal of Milestone 1 was to create a set of HTML pages providing a mockup of the pages in the system. To simplify things, the mockup was developed as a Meteor app. This meant that each page was a template and that FlowRouter was used to implement routing to the pages.

Mockups for the following five pages were implemented during M1:
<ul>
<li> Landing page </li>
<li> Profile page </li>
<li> Home page </li>
<li> Browse page </li>
<li> Event page </li>
</ul>


Milestone 1 was implemented as [Campusjam GitHub Milestone M1](https://github.com/campusjam/campusjam/milestone/1):
